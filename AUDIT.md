JOELTOM VPN — Adaptation audit
Basis
This package was adapted directly from the supplied JOELTOM_VPN-ScriptAll-main.zip reference project.

Preserved
Core protocol scripts and their functional structure.
Xray, OpenVPN, ZIVPN, SlowDNS, UDP Custom, BadVPN, Nginx and WebSocket modules from the supplied project.
External upstream dependency URLs used by those modules.
Adapted
Project identity: JOELTOM VPN.
Repository endpoints: joeltom_tech/JOELTOM_VPN.
Project-owned service/path names: katashie-*.
Web panel branding and project paths.
Cameroon/Yaoundé timezone: Africa/Douala.
Terminal presentation: green/red/cyan/magenta/yellow reference style.
Animated JOELTOM ASCII signature.
Installer progress/error presentation and per-component log files.
OTA updater to refresh menu/core/UI/launcher and update the web panel without deleting its configuration.
Complete JOELTOM uninstaller.
Static checks performed
bash -n on all shell scripts: passed.
Python compilation check on all Python files: passed.
JSON parsing checks: passed for JSON configuration files checked.
No remaining project-owned references to RootJOELTOM, JOELTOM_VPN-ScriptAll, Nexus Tunnel Pro, nexus-web, or nexus_bot were found outside excluded upstream/binary data.
Important
Static checks do not replace a real VPS installation test. Network-dependent protocol binaries, certificates, DNS records and provider-specific firewall behavior must still be validated on the target VPS.
